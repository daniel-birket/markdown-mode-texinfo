@chapter Introduction
@cindex Introduction
@cindex markdown
This manual describes how to install and use @code{markdown-mode}, an Emacs
package for working with markdown-formatted text. The features of this
package assist the user to insert and manipulate markdown-compatible
markup syntax and to use the external @command{markdown} command to
convert the markdown-formatted text to HTML-formatted text.

The package implements two Emacs @emph{major modes}:
@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{markdown-mode}, for editing standard markdown text.
@xref{Using Markdown Mode}.

@item
@code{gfm-mode}, for editing GitHub-flavored markdown text.
@xref{Using GFM Mode}.
@end itemize

@pindex markdown
@command{markdown}, created by John Gruber in 2004, is a popular unix
filter command that provides an easy way to produce styled text by
editing simple text files and then converting the text to HTML.  It is
described at @uref{http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/}.

@command{markdown} has been reimplimented by various authors and with
various additional features and syntax, including
@command{multimarkdown}, @command{pandoc}, @command{python markdown}
and many others.

GitHub Flavored Markdown is the dialect of markdown used by GitHub. It
is described at
@uref{http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/}.

@pindex emacs
@command{emacs} is a powerful text editor (and more).  It is highly
extensible and has a large ecosystem of extensions like this one.  GNU
emacs is described at @uref{https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/}.

@node Recommended Installation
@section Recommended Installation
@cindex Recommended Installation
@cindex How to Install with @code{package.el}
@cindex MELPA Stable
@findex package.el
The recommended way to install the package @code{markdown-mode} is to
use @code{package.el}, which has been integrated with Emacs since
version 24. (It is included in version 23, but must be initialized.)

To install @code{markdown-mode}, first add the MELPA Stable archive to
the list of archives used by @code{package.el} by adding the following
lines to your @file{.emacs}, @file{init.el}, or other Emacs startup
file and restarting Emacs (or just evaluate the statements):

@cartouche
@lisp
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("melpa-stable" . "https://stable.melpa.org/packages/"))
(package-initialize)
@end lisp
@end cartouche

@findex package-install
Then, after restarting Emacs (or otherwise evaulating the above
statements), type the following command:

@kbd{M-x package-install @key{RET} markdown-mode @key{RET}}.

When installed using the package manager this way, the major modes
@code{markdown-mode} and @code{gfm-mode} will be autoloaded, and
@code{markdown-mode} will be used automatically for file names ending
in either @file{.md} or @file{.markdown}.

You may browse the 1500+ packages in the MELPA-Stable archive at @uref{http://stable.melpa.org/} or by typing @kbd{M-x list-packages @key{RET}} (after adding it to your package-archives list, above).

@node Manual Installation
@section Manual Installation
@cindex Manual Installation
@cindex How to Install Manually
@cindex How to Download Manually
You can manually download and install markdown-mode.

First, download @code{markdown-mode} from one of:

@itemize @bullet
@item @uref{http://jblevins.org/projects/markdown-mode/markdown-mode.el}
@item @uref{http://stable.melpa.org/}
@end itemize

and save the file where Emacs can find it in a directory listed in your
@code{load-path} like @file{/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp}.

Then configure @code{markdown-mode} and @code{gfm-mode}
to load automatically by adding the following to your init file:

@cartouche
@lisp
(autoload 'markdown-mode
          "markdown-mode"
          "Major mode for editing Markdown files" t)
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.markdown\\'" . markdown-mode))
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.md\\'" . markdown-mode))

(autoload 'gfm-mode
          "markdown-mode"
          "Major mode for editing GitHub Flavored Markdown files" t)
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("README\\.md\\'" . gfm-mode))
@end lisp
@end cartouche

This package, @code{markdown-mode.el}, depends on the package
@code{cl-lib}, which has been bundled with GNU Emacs since version
24.3. If you use GNU Emacs version 24.1 or 24.2, you should install
@code{cl-lib} using @code{package.el}. To install @code{cl-lib} type
@kbd{M-x package-install @key{RET} cl-lib @key{RET}}

@node Managed Loading
@section Managed Loading
@cindex Managed Loading
@cindex How to Manage with @code{use-package}
@findex use-package.el
If you manage loading packages with @code{use-package} then you can
automatically install and configure @code{markdown-mode} by adding a
declaration such as this one to your init file (This is an
example. Please adjust these settings as desired):

@cartouche
@lisp
(use-package markdown-mode
  :ensure t
  :commands (markdown-mode gfm-mode)
  :mode (("README\\.md\\'" . gfm-mode)
         ("\\.md\\'" . markdown-mode)
         ("\\.markdown\\'" . markdown-mode))
  :init (setq markdown-command "multimarkdown"))
@end lisp
@end cartouche

@code{use-package} is documented at @uref{https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package}

@cindex How to Download a Linux Package
You may download @code{markdown-mode} in packages for use with several
OS package managers. Most OS packages do not contain the latest stable
version.  (Please notify the package maintainer if you download one
that does not.) Note that OS package managers generally do NOT
byte-compile or configure @code{markdown-mode} to load
automatically. Please see the instructions under @ref{Manual

Note: John Gruber created @command{markdown} to handle two pre-existing
types of titles and headers: the underlined titles supported by
@command{setext} by Ian Feldman and the headers marked with hashmarks
supported by @command{atx} by Aaron Swartz. @code{markdown-mode}
refers to these header styles as @command{setext} and @command{atx}
headers.

@node Inserting Headers
@subsection Inserting Headers
@cindex Inserting Headers
@cindex How to Insert Headers
This subsection describes how to insert headers.

All header insertion commands use the text in the active region, if
any, as the header text.  Otherwise, if the current line is not
blank, they use the text on the current line. The setext-style
(underlined) header insert commands will prompt for header text if
there is no active region and the current line is blank.

The prefix for this group of header insert commands is @kbd{C-c C-t}.

@table @asis
@item @kbd{C-c C-t h} (@code{markdown-insert-header-dwim})
@kindex C-c C-t h
@findex markdown-insert-header-dwim
This will insert or replace 'appropriate' header markup.

The level and type of the header will match the type and level of the
previous header, unless a prefix argument is used.

@kbd{C-1 C-c C-t h} through @kbd{C-6 C-c C-t h}

With a numeric prefix @kbd{C-1} to @kbd{C-6}, this inserts a header of
the given level, with the type being determined automatically (Note
that only level 1 or 2 setext headers are possible).

@kbd{C-u C-c C-t h} and @kbd{C-u C-u C-c C-t h}

With a @kbd{C-u} prefix, this promotes the header by one level.  With a
@kbd{C-u C-u} prefix, this demotes the header by one level.

When there is an active region, this will use it for the header text.  When the
point is at an existing header, it will change the type and level according to
the rules above.  Otherwise, if the line is not empty, it will create a header
using the text on the current line as the header text.  Finally, if
the point is on a blank line, it will insert empty header markup (atx) or
prompt for text (setext).

@item @kbd{C-c C-t H} (@code{markdown-insert-header-setext-dwim})
@kindex C-c C-t H
@findex markdown-insert-header-setext-dwim
This will insert setext-style (underlined) headers when possible. (Note
that only level 1 or 2 setext headers are possible).

@kbd{C-1 C-c C-t H} inserts level-one setext-style headers.

@kbd{C-2 C-c C-t H} inserts level-two setext-style headers.

@kbd{C-u C-c C-t H} and @kbd{C-u C-u C-c C-t H} insert higher or lower level setext-style headers, if possible.

@end table

To insert a specific style and level of header use one of the
commands below. If the point is at a header, these commands will
replace the existing markup in order to update the level and/or type
of the header.

@strong{atx-style (#) Headers}

@table @asis
@item @kbd{C-c C-t 1} (@code{markdown-insert-header-atx-1})
@kindex C-c C-t 1
@findex markdown-insert-header-atx-1
This inserts a first-level atx-style (#) header, using the text in the
active region or the text on the current line, if any.

@item @kbd{C-c C-t 2} (@code{markdown-insert-header-atx-2})
@kindex C-c C-t 2
@findex markdown-insert-header-atx-2
This inserts a second-level atx-style (##) header, using the text in the
active region or the text on the current line, if any.

@item @kbd{C-c C-t 3} (@code{markdown-insert-header-atx-3})
@kindex C-c C-t 3
@findex markdown-insert-header-atx-3
This inserts a third-level atx-style (###) header, using the text in the
active region or the text on the current line, if any.

@item @kbd{C-c C-t 4} (@code{markdown-insert-header-atx-4})
@kindex C-c C-t 4
@findex markdown-insert-header-atx-4
This inserts a fourth-level atx-style (####) header, using the text in the

@item @kbd{C-c C-t 5} (@code{markdown-insert-header-atx-5})
@kindex C-c C-t 5
@findex markdown-insert-header-atx-5

For example, it ensures that the underline portion of a setext header
is the same length as the heading text, or that the number of leading

no extra whitespace in the header text.

@item @kbd{C-c C-c ]} (@code{markdown-complete-buffer})

Headings, horizontal rules, and list items can be promoted and
demoted, as well as bold and italic text.

For headings, "promotion" means @emph{decreasing} the level (i.e.,
moving from @samp{<h2>} to @samp{<h1>}) while "demotion" means
@emph{increasing} the level.

For horizontal rules, promotion and demotion means moving backward or
forward through the list of rule strings in
@code{markdown-hr-strings}.  For bold and italic text, promotion and
demotion means changing the markup from underscores to asterisks.

To remember these commands, note that @kbd{-} is for decreasing the
level (promoting), and @kbd{=} (on the same key as @kbd{+}) is for
increasing the level (demoting).  Similarly, the @key{LEFT} and
@key{RIGHT} arrow keys indicate the direction that the atx heading
markup is moving in when promoting or demoting.

@table @asis
@item @kbd{C-c C-s e} (@code{markdown-insert-italic})
@kindex C-c C-s e
@findex markdown-insert-italic
This inserts markup to @emph{emphasize} a region or word with
@emph{italic} face, or removes the existing italic emphasis.

If there is an active region, it makes the region italic.  If the
point is at a non-italic word, it makes the word italic.  If the point
is at an italic word or phrase, it removes the italic markup.
Otherwise, it simply inserts italic delimiters and place the cursor
between them.

@item @kbd{C-c C-s s} (@code{markdown-insert-bold})
@kindex C-c C-s s
@findex markdown-insert-bold
This inserts markup for @strong{strong} emphasis of a region or word
with @strong{bold} face, or removes the existing bold strong
emphasis.

If there is an active region, it makes the region bold.  If the point
is at a non-italic word, it makes the word bold.  If the point is at
an bold word or phrase, it removes the bold markup.  Otherwise, it
simply inserts bold delimiters and place the cursor between them.

@item @kbd{C-c C-s c} (@code{markdown-insert-code})
@kindex C-c C-s c
@findex markdown-insert-code
Insert markup to make a region or word an inline code fragment.

If there is an active region, make the region an inline code fragment.
If the point is at a word, make the word an inline code fragment.
Otherwise, simply insert code delimiters and place the cursor
between them.

@item @kbd{C-c C-s k} (@code{markdown-insert-kbd})
@kindex C-c C-s k
@findex markdown-insert-kbd
Insert markup to wrap a region or word in <kbd> tags.

If there is an active region, use the region.  If the point is at a
word, use the word.  Otherwise, simply insert <kbd> tags and place the
cursor between them. (@code{markdown-mode} version 2.2).

@item @kbd{C-c C-s b} (@code{markdown-insert-blockquote})
@kindex C-c C-s b
@findex markdown-insert-blockquote
This inserts blockquote markup around the active region, if any, or
inserts empty blockquote markup.

@item @kbd{C-c C-s C-b} (@code{markdown-blockquote-region})
@kindex C-c C-s C-b
@findex markdown-blockquote-region
This variation of the insert-blockquote function (above) always
operates on the region, regardless of whether it is active or not.

The appropriate amount of indentation, if any, is calculated
automatically given the surrounding context, but may be adjusted later
using the region indentation commands.

@item @kbd{C-c C-s p} (@code{markdown-insert-pre})
@kindex C-c C-s p
@findex markdown-insert-pre
This inserts preformatted code block markup around the active region,
if any, or inserts empty preformatted code block markup.

@cindex How to Insert Inline Links
This inserts an inline link of the form @samp{[text](url)}. The link
text is determined as follows:  If there is an active region
(i.e., when transient mark mode is on and the mark is active), use it
as the link text.  Otherwise, if the point is at a word, use that word as
the link text.  In these two cases, the original text will be replaced
with the link and point will be left at the position for inserting a
URL.  Otherwise, insert empty link markup and place the point for
inserting the link text.

@cindex How to Insert Reference Links
(@kbd{C-c C-a r} depreciated keybinding)
This inserts a reference link of the form @samp{[text][label]} and an
optional corresponding reference label definition.  The region (if
active) or the word at point (if any) will be used for the link text.
If neither is available, then the link text will be read from the
minibuffer.

The reference label will be read from the minibuffer, with completion
from the set of currently defined references.  To create an implicit
reference link, press @key{RET} to accept the default empty label.  If
the entered reference label is not defined, it will prompt for the URL
and an optional title.

If a URL is provided, a reference definition will be inserted in
accordance with @code{markdown-reference-location}.  If a title is given,
it will be added to the end of the reference definition and will be
used to populate the title attribute when converted to XHTML.

@item @kbd{C-c C-a u} (@code{markdown-insert-uri})

@item markdown-command-needs-filename
@vindex markdown-command-needs-filename
@code{nil} or @code{t}, default: @code{nil}.

Set @code{markdown-command-needs-filename} to @code{t} if the program
specified by @code{markdown-command} needs a filename, that is, if the
program does not accept standard input (@code{stdin}).

When @code{markdown-command-needs-filename} is set to @code{nil}, the
default, @code{markdown-mode} will pass the markdown content to the
program specified by @code{markdown-command} using standard input
(@code{stdin}).

When @code{markdown-command-needs-filename} is set to @code{t} (or any
non-@code{nil}), @code{markdown-mode} will pass the name of the file
visited by the current buffer as the final command-line argument to
the program specified by @code{markdown-command}. Note that in this
case, you will only be able to run @code{markdown-command} from
buffers that are visiting a file.

@item markdown-open-command
@vindex markdown-open-command
@cindex How to Customize markdown-open
@cindex How to Customize @kbd{C-c C-c o}
string, default: @code{nil}.

This variable specifies the command and options that the function
@code{markdown-open}, bound to @kbd{C-c C-c o}, will use to open the
markdown file in an external markdown previewer application. The
command will be called with a single argument: the name of the file
visited by the buffer. (This only works if the buffer is visiting a
file.)

One possible previewer application is @cite{Marked 2} by Brett
Terpstra, a live-updating Markdown previewer available from
the Apple app store.

You can can open an OSX app like @cite{Marked 2} by running a script
like the one below with the @code{markdown-open-command}.

Script @file{/usr/local/bin/markview}
@cartouche
@example
#!/bin/bash
# Check that file exists and launch app with or without it.
if [[ -f $1 ]]
then open -a "Marked 2" $1

@node Customizing Markdown Format
@section Customizing Markdown Format
@cindex Customizing Markdown Format
@cindex How to Customize Markdown Format
The variables in this section control how @code{markdown-mode} formats
Markdown text. These variables may be set in the Emacs startup file or by using @kbd{M-x customize-mode}.

@vtable @code
@item markdown-bold-underscore
@code{nil} or @code{t}, default: @code{nil}.

Set to a non-nil value to use two underscores when inserting bold text
instead of two asterisks.

@item markdown-italic-underscore
@code{nil} or @code{t}, default: @code{nil}.

Set to a non-nil value to use single underscores when inserting italic
text instead of single asterisks.

@item markdown-reference-location
One of @code{header} (the default), @code{end}, or @code{immediately}

This value determines where to insert reference definitions. The
possible locations are:

@itemize
@item @code{header} - before the next header.
@item @code{end} - the end of the document.
@item @code{immediately} - after the current block.
@end itemize

Example:
@cartouche
@lisp
(setq markdown-reference-location 'end)
@end lisp
@end cartouche

@item markdown-footnote-location
One of @code{header}, @code{end} (the default), or @code{immediately}

This value determines where to insert footnote text. The possible
locations are the same as for @code{markdown-reference-location},
above.

@item comment-auto-fill-only-comments
@code{nil} or @code{t}, default: @code{nil}.

This variable is made buffer-local and set to @code{nil} by default.
In programming language modes, when this variable is non-nil, only
comments will be filled by @code{auto-fill-mode}.  However, comments
in Markdown documents are rare and the most users probably intend for
the actual content of the document to be filled.  Making this variable
buffer-local allows @code{markdown-mode} to override the default
behavior induced when the global variable is non-nil.

@end vtable

@node Customizing Markdown Headers
@section Customizing Markdown Headers
@cindex Customizing Markdown Headers
@cindex How to Customize Markdown Headers
The variables in this section allow you to customize how
@code{markdown-mode} uses headers.

@vtable @code

@item markdown-asymmetric-header
@code{nil} or @code{t}, default: @code{nil}.

Determines if header style will be asymmetric.

Set to non-nil to only have header characters to the left of the title.
The default will ensure header characters are placed to the left and right
of the title.

@item markdown-header-scaling
@code{nil} or @code{t}, default: @code{nil}.

Determines whether to use variable-height faces for headers.

Set to a non-nil value to use a variable-pitch font for headers where
the size corresponds to the level of the header.

In detail: When non-nil, @code{markdown-header-face} will inherit from
@code{variable-pitch} and the six scaling values in
@code{markdown-header-scaling-values} will be applied to headers of
levels one through six respectively.
    
@item markdown-header-scaling-values
A list of 6 float, default: @code{(list 1.8 1.4 1.2 1.0 1.0 1.0)}

A list of 6 scaling values, relative to baseline, for headers of levels
one through six. They are used when `markdown-header-scaling` is non-nil.

@item markdown-nested-imenu-header-index
@code{nil} or @code{t}, default: @code{nil}.

Set to a non-nil value to use nested imenu header instead of a flat
index.  A nested index may provide more natural browsing from the
menu, but a flat list may allow for faster keyboard navigation via tab
completion.

@item markdown-hr-strings
A list of 6 strings. The default is:

@lisp
("-------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
 "* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *"
 "---------------------------------------"
 "* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *"
 "---------"
 "* * * * *")
 @end lisp

A list of strings to use when inserting horizontal rules.  Different
strings will not be distinguished when converted to HTML -- they
will all be converted to @code{<hr/>} -- but they may add visual
distinction and style to plain text documents.  To maintain some
notion of promotion and demotion, keep these sorted from largest
to smallest.

@end vtable

@node Customizing Indenting
@section Customizing Indenting
@cindex Customizing Indenting
@cindex How to Customize Indenting
The variables in this section allow you to customize how

@vtable @code

@item markdown-list-indent-width
integer, default: 4

Determines the depth of indentation for lists when inserting,
promoting, and demoting list items.

@item markdown-indent-function
function, default: @code{markdown-indent-line}

@section [[Wiki-Links]] Syntax Highlighting
@cindex [[Wiki-Links]] Syntax Highlighting
@cindex Wiki Links Syntax Highlighting
@cindex Highlighting [[Wiki-Links]] Syntax
@cindex How to Highlight [[Wiki-Links]]

Besides supporting the basic Markdown syntax, @code{markdown-mode} also
includes syntax highlighting for [[Wiki-Links]].  This support is
enabled by setting @code{markdown-enable-wiki-links} to a non-nil value.

Wiki-links may be followed by pressing @kbd{C-c C-o} when the point
is at a wiki-link.  Use @kbd{M-p} and @kbd{M-n} to quickly jump to the
previous and next links (including links of other types).

Aliased (or ``piped'') wiki-links of the form
@samp{[[linktext|PageName]]} are also supported.  Since some wikis
reverse these components, set @code{markdown-wiki-link-alias-first} to
nil to treat them as @samp{[[PageName|linktext]]}.

If @code{markdown-wiki-link-fontify-missing}
is also non-nil, @code{markdown-mode} will highlight wiki-links with a
missing target file in a different color.  By default, Markdown
Mode only searches for target files in the current directory.
Sequential parent directory search (like @command{Ikiwiki}) can be
enabled by setting @code{markdown-wiki-link-search-parent-directories}
to a non-nil value.

The variables below customize how Wiki-Links are handled.

@vtable @code

@item markdown-enable-wiki-links
@findex markdown-toggle-wiki-links
@code{nil} or @code{t}, default: @code{nil}.

This enables syntax highlighting for [[Wiki-Links]].

Set this to a non-nil value to turn on [[Wiki-Links]] support by
default.  [[Wiki-Links]] support can be toggled later using the
function @code{markdown-toggle-wiki-links}.

@item markdown-link-space-sub-char
character, default: @code{"_"}

Determines the character to replace spaces when mapping wiki links to
filenames.

For example, use an underscore for compatibility with the Python
Markdown WikiLinks extension.  In @code{gfm-mode}, this is set to
@code{"-"} to conform with GitHub wiki links.

@item markdown-wiki-link-alias-first
@code{nil} or @code{t}, default: @code{t}.

Set this to a non-nil value to treat aliased wiki links as
@samp{[[linktext|PageName]]}.  When set to nil, they will be treated
as @samp{[[PageName|linktext]]}.

@item markdown-wiki-link-fontify-missing
@code{nil} or @code{t}, default: @code{nil}.

When non-nil, change the wiki-link face according to the existence of
the target files.

This is expensive because it requires checking for the file each time the buffer
changes or the user switches windows.  It is disabled by default because it may
cause lag when typing on slower machines.

@item markdown-wiki-link-search-parent-directories
@pindex ikiwiki
@code{nil} or @code{t}, default: @code{nil}.

When non-nil, search for wiki-link targets in parent
directories. (This is the default search behavior of Ikiwiki.)

This only applies when @code{markdown-wiki-link-fontify-missing},
above, is non-nil.

See @uref{https://ikiwiki.info}

@node Customizing GitHub Flavored Markdown
@section Customizing GitHub Flavored Markdown
@cindex Customizing GitHub Flavored Markdown
@cindex How to Customize Markdown Format

This section describes variables that customize @code{gfm-mode}.

@vtable @code

@item markdown-gfm-additional-languages
list of strings, default @code{nil}

Determines any more languages to make available, in addition to the
300+ languages predefined in @code{markdown-gfm-recognized-languages},
when inserting GFM code blocks. Language strings must be trimmed of
whitespace and not contain any curly braces. They may be of arbitrary
capitalization.

@item markdown-gfm-use-electric-backquote
@findex markdown-electric-backquote
@code{nil} or @code{t}, default @code{t}

Set to non-nill to use the function @code{markdown-electric-backquote}
for interactive insertion of GFM code blocks when backquote is pressed
three times.

@item markdown-make-gfm-checkboxes-buttons
@code{nil} or @code{t}, default @code{t}

Determines whether GitHub Flavored Markdown style task lists
(checkboxes) should be turned into buttons that can be toggled with
mouse-1 or RET. If non-nil, then buttons are enabled.  This works in
@code{markdown-mode} as well as @code{gfm-mode}.

@node Customizing HTML Format
@section Customizing HTML Format
@cindex Customizing HTML Format
@cindex How to Customize HTML Format

This section describes variables that customize HTML formatting.

@vtable @code

@item markdown-uri-types
list of strings, default: @code{("acap" "cid" "data" "dav" "fax"
"file" "ftp" "gopher" "http" "https" "imap" "ldap" "mailto" "mid"
"modem" "news" "nfs" "nntp" "pop" "prospero" "rtsp" "service" "sip"
"tel" "telnet" "tip" "urn" "vemmi" "wais")}

Determines the list of protocol schemes (e.g., @code{"http"}) for URIs
that @code{markdown-mode} should highlight.

@item markdown-css-paths
list of strings, default @code{nil}

Determines a list of URLs of CSS files to link to in the output XHTML.

@item markdown-content-type
string, default: @code{""}

when set to a nonempty string, an @samp{http-equiv} attribute will be
included in the XHTML @samp{<head>} block.  The suggested values are
@code{"application/xhtml+xml"} or @code{"text/html"}.

This variable must be set to a non-empty string to use
@code{markdown-coding-system}, below.

@item markdown-coding-system
string or @code{nil}, default: @code{nil}

This variable is used for specifying the character set identifier in
the @samp{http-equiv} attribute when included.  The variable
@code{markdown-content-type} must be set before this variable has any
effect.  When @code{markdown-coding-system} is set to @code{nil},
@code{buffer-file-coding-system} will be used to automatically
determine the coding system string (falling back to @samp{iso-8859-1}
when unavailable).  Common settings are @samp{utf-8} and
@samp{iso-latin-1}.

@item markdown-xhtml-header-content
string, default @code{""}

Determines any additional content to include in the XHTML @samp{<head>}
block.

@item markdown-xhtml-standalone-regexp
string, default @code{^\\(<\\?xml\\|<!DOCTYPE\\|<html\\)}

a regular expression which @code{markdown-mode} uses to determine
whether the output of @code{markdown-command} is a standalone XHTML
document or an XHTML fragment.  If this regular expression is not
matched in the first five lines of output, @code{markdown-mode}
assumes the output is a fragment and adds a header and footer.

This section describes the variable that enables @LaTeX{} Math Syntax
highlighting.

@vtable @code

@item markdown-enable-math
@code{nil} or @code{t}, default: @code{nil}.

Syntax highlighting for mathematical expressions written in @LaTeX{}
can be enabled by default by setting @code{markdown-enable-math} to a
non-nil value. You can set it either via customize or by placing @code{(setq
markdown-enable-math t)} in @file{.emacs}, and then restarting
Emacs or calling @code{markdown-reload-extensions}.

Only expressions denoted by @samp{$..$}, @samp{$$..$$}, or
@samp{\[..\]} are highlighted.

Math support can be toggled later using @kbd{M-x markdown-enable-math}.
